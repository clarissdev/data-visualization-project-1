## Introduction

## Question 1: How do the patterns of educational attainment among young people in English towns vary based on the types of activities they engage in at age 19, and what role do socio-economic factors play in shaping these patterns?

### Visualization

### Analysis

## Question 2: England is known as a country in which coastal towns are considered left behind in socio-economy compared to non-coastal towns. What are some potential underlying reasons for the observed differences in educational attainment among young people across coastal and non-coastal towns in England?

This box plot visualizes the comparison of educational scores across three categories of towns: coastal, non-coastal, and those with unspecified status (NA). The plot shows the median, interquartile range (IQR), and outliers for educational scores in each category. Through this, we can observe that:

- The median educational score for non-coastal towns is above that of coastal towns, suggesting that, on average, non-coastal towns have higher educational attainment.

- The spread of scores, as indicated by the IQR (the box), is larger for non-coastal towns than for coastal towns, implying more variability in the educational outcomes for non-coastal towns.

- Both coastal and non-coastal towns have outliers, which are the data points displayed as individual dots outside the whiskers of the box plot. These outliers indicate towns with exceptionally high or low educational scores compared to the rest of their group.

Overall, this visualization highlights potential disparities in educational attainment between coastal and non-coastal towns, with non-coastal towns appearing to have a higher median educational score. However, the presence of outliers suggests there are exceptions to the general trend. These insights can help guide further investigation into the factors contributing to these differences, such as economic opportunities, access to educational resources, and other socio-economic factors specific to coastal and non-coastal regions.

This violin plot illustrates the distribution of education scores across three job density categories—Mixed, Residential, and Working—for both coastal and non-coastal towns. From this plot, we can see that:

- Width of Violins: The width of each violin represents the density of data points at different education score levels. Wider sections of the violin indicate a higher concentration of towns with similar education scores.

- Distribution Shape: The shape of the violins for the coastal towns is quite distinct from those of the non-coastal towns. Coastal towns appear to have a narrower distribution, especially in the 'Mixed' and 'Working' job density categories, suggesting less variability in education scores compared to non-coastal towns.

- Education Score Range: Both coastal and non-coastal towns show a wide range of education scores, as evidenced by the length of the violins, but non-coastal towns seem to have a slightly broader range, implying more variation in education outcomes.

Comparing Coastal vs. Non-Coastal education scores, we can also observe additional insights:

- In the 'Mixed' category, coastal towns have a more pronounced peak around the lower end of the education score spectrum, while non-coastal towns have a more even distribution.

- In the 'Residential' category, both town types show similar patterns, but non-coastal towns have a slightly higher density of scores in the middle range.

- In the 'Working' category, non-coastal towns show a peak at a higher education score level than coastal towns.

This visualization would be valuable for stakeholders interested in the relationship between economic activity (as indicated by job density) and educational attainment, potentially informing targeted interventions in areas with lower education scores. We can see that the overall spread and central density of education scores are visibly different between coastal and non-coastal towns across the job density categories. There may be an underlying relationship between job density and education scores that varies with coastal status, which could be influenced by various factors such as the availability of educational resources, economic opportunities, or demographic characteristics. This plot suggests that, in general, non-coastal towns may have a more varied educational performance compared to coastal towns, but further analysis would be needed to understand the causes and implications of these patterns.
